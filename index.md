## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
 The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been trying to understand San Diego and how the region is composed of. As well as what factors go into economic forecasting. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
   I would like to investigate how San Diego as a region differentiates between others when it comes to economic growth. The San Diego region is a border county so that is different. I think investigating the main differences will lead to good forecasting. I think overall there can be a lot of investiating as to whether it would be best to group in clusters or by zip codes, however best seems to predict.   

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
  In Quarter 1 the approach we will take is implementing Machine Learning approaches in order to forecast these jobs/economic growths. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
  I would be interested in using feature engineering.
